# Procedural Terrain

This repository contains implementations of procedural terrain generation algorithms. As of now
it only contains Diamond-Square[1], but more, such as Perlin Noise[2], may be added in the future.
These implementations are entirely for fun and for personal learning. I also will do write-ups on
each of the algorithms I add, which will be linked to in this README, so check them out!

## Writeups
